vmt_to_vmat.py

A simple Python 2.7 batch converter to convert Source 1 .mvt material scripts to the Source 2 .vmat format.
The material parameters does not map one to one, so it won't convert the materials perfectly. 

Usage: Run the script with material files or directories contaioning them as argumnets (or simply drag and drop the file/dir on the script file). WARNING: Will overwrite any vmat files it converts.
